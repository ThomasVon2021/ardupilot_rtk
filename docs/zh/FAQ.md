# FAQ

## Installation

* Can I use the GRTK without any settings when I get it?

> A: Of course! GRTK are all set and tested before we send it to you. 

* I bought a GRTK kit, but how can I identify which one is base and which one is rover?

> A: We will label different devices respectively. 

* The rover station has 2 antennas, where does GRTK positioning data mean?

> A: The master antenna, aka "ANT1", represents the location GRTK is positioning.

## Extra Settings

* How can I set a special NMEA output not only default settings?

> A: You can config GRTK by serial port, please follow [GRTK User Manual](GRTK_User_Manual.md).


## Others

* Can GRTK rover station work with a base station but not GRTK base which supports RTCM data?

> A: Of course. But you should have a special config for your base station to adapt to our rover station. We strongly suggest that use a GRTK kit for RTK positioning, and we can't make sure the rover station's performance.

* Can serval rover stations work with only one base station?

> A: Yes, you can have a **point to multipoint** RLINK kit to make GRTKs work.
