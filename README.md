# GRTK For Ardupilot
High precision RTK module, supporting gps for yaw

##Introduction
* **G-RTK** is a dual-antenna high-precision differential positioning and directional module (Real Time Kinematics) independently developed by **Blicube**. A complete RTK system can be formed through two G-RTK modules (one mobile terminal and one base station terminal).

* The module is based on a new generation of high-performance GNSS SoC chip design,supports multi-system multi-frequency RTK positioning, supports dual-antenna high-precision orientation, and supports **GPS & GLONASS & Beidou & Galileo & QZSS** navigation and positioning. It is mainly for high-precision positioning and orientation requirements such as drones, robots and intelligent driving.
